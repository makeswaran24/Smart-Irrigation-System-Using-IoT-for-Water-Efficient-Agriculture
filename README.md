# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-IoT-for-Water-Efficient-Agriculture
The Smart Precision Irrigation System Using IoT for Water-Efficient Agriculture  automates irrigation by managing two water sources, borewell and rainwater. 
This ensures a continuous and efficient water supply for crops.The system uses an ESP8266 microcontroller connected with ultrasonic sensors to monitor water levels in the tank.
It also has a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and a soil moisture sensor to check how dry the soil is. 
Based on real-time sensor data, the system favors borewell water for irrigation and switches to the rainwater tank when the borewell level drops below a certain point. Motor operations are controlled through relays.
All key parameters are sent to the Adafruit IO cloud platform, allowing for remote monitoring and data analysis.
This IoT-based method reduces manual work, saves water, and supports sustainable farming through smart, data-driven irrigation management. 
The system is a cost-effective and scalable solution for both small and large farms. 
It helps farmers make better decisions by showing live data and trends over time. Cloud monitoring increases transparency and accessibility from anywhere. 
The project also encourages using renewable rainwater resources to reduce groundwater depletion. 
Overall, it shows how IoT can transform modern agriculture by improving water use and crop productivity.
